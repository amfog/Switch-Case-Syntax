# Switch-Case-Syntax
Switch Case Syntax and how to use it
//first of all let’s start up by making our main function
void main() {
  // remember switch case statements is only applicable
  //for //int and string
  // first we going to assign a variable, String and we will give it a value
  String grade = 'A';
  // here comes the use of switch
  switch (grade) {
    case 'A':
    //once it matches the grade a print
    // so in case if the grade is A print excellent grade of a
      print('Excellent Grade of A');
      break;
  //otherwise break
  //lets make some other cases
    case 'B':
      print('very good');
      break;
    case 'C':
      print('good but you need to work hard');
      break;

  //but like that we may have a problem later on, when  user uses an invalid input like “123” or “abc”
  //so we may need to change this ‘default’ case and add a new failure case
  //and don’t forget to remove the ‘default’ we have used up there
    case 'F':
      print('you have failed');
      break;
    default:
      print('Invalid Input');
  }
}
